<h3 id="target">Why was the target attribute removed from XHTML 1.1?</h3>

<p>It wasn't. XHTML 1.0 comes in three versions: strict, transitional, and frameset. All three of these were deliberately kept as close as possible to HTML 4.01 as XML would allow. XHTML 1.1 is an updated version of XHTML 1.0 <em>strict</em>, and no version of HTML strict has ever included the <code>target</code> attribute. The other two versions, transitional and frameset, were not updated, because there was nothing to update. If you want to use the <code>target</code> attribute, use XHTML 1.0 transitional.<br /><br />I took this text from W3C website about XHTML 1.1<br />so I think you should keep your target attributes and just convert to XHTML transitional.</p>
