	<h1>Restricting Untrusted HTML With Javascript</h1>
	<p><em>Last updated 8/31/2007 2:17 AM PDT</em></p>
	<div>
	<p>
	This work was inspired by <a href="http://www.mindedsecurity.com/">Stefano Di Paola's</a> work on 
	<a href="http://www.wisec.it/sectou.php?id=46c5843ea4900">Preventing XSS with Data Binding</a>.
	</p>
	<p>This page describes and demonstrates a way to display untrusted content (e.g. a blog comment containing
	HTML markup):
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>safely,</li>
	<li>without <em>requiring</em> javascript,</li>
	<li>with minimal server overhead</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here's how it works:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Enclose the untrusted content in a &lt;table&gt; element.  Now the only way for the untrusted content to
	get it's content out of the table (or trusted content into its table) is by closing the table (or starting a 
	new one).  To prevent that the server just needs to replace "&lt;table" with 
	"&amp;lt;table" and "&lt;/table" with "&amp;lt;/table" in the untrusted content.</li>
	<li>Style the table (or a containing div) to ensure that the content in the table cant use styles to display 
	something "outside the box".  These first 2 steps are sufficient to protect non-javascript users.</li>
	<li>Use document.write() to inject some special markup just before the untrusted content.  The injected markup
	is chosen to cause the browser's
	parser to not treat subsequent text as markup.  For most browsers, inject "&lt;!&#45;&#45;" to start a comment. 
	On browsers where the DOM doesn't provide access to the contents of
	comments (e.g. Safari and Konqueror), inject "&lt;xmp&gt;"	instead (which for historical reasons stops 
	processing normal markup).</li>
	<li>Put the close tags that correspond to our injected markup after the untrusted content.  To prevent the 
	untrusted content from escaping the javascript-injected jail, the server needs to replace "&#45;&#45;" with
	"&amp;#45;&amp;#45;" and "&lt;/xmp" with "&amp;lt;/xmp".  The server should also remove any HTML comments before
	doing those replacements.
	They aren't a security threat, but they will corrupt the display of the 
	untrusted content.  If the app that doesn't expect benign content to contain comments, it does not need
	to strip	comments because only malicious content will be corrupted.</li>
	<li>Use javascript and the DOM to extract the untrusted content, filter it, and replace our javscript-injected
	jail with the result.  The filter converts the untrusted "tag soup" content into safe well-formed HTML.
	It can be configured to allow, prohibit, or modify, any element, attribute, or style.  The default
	configuration is designed to prohibit Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other similar attacks.  
	To ensure that "tag soup" is displayed properly and to maximize cross-browser compatibility, the filter uses a 
	regex based parser instead of using the XML parser available in many browsers.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	To play with this, save this page and look at the HTML source.  Find the the untrusted
	content and try replacing it with something that will execute script.  The only rules are that you 
	need to do replacements mentioned above that the server would normally do to the untrusted content.
	</p>
	<p>
	The current implementation seems to work with:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 7</li>
	<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 6, except that when javascript is disabled the untrusted content
	is displayed in a fixed size div (with scroll bars if necessary).  This is necessary to prevent
	absolutely positioned untrusted content from displaying outside the box.</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox (FF) versions 1.5 and 2.0</li>
	<li>Opera 9</li>
	<li>Netscape 7.2, except that when javascript is disabled the untrusted content
	is displayed in a fixed size div with no scroll bars.</li>
	<li>Mac Safari versions 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0.</li>
	<li>Windows Safari version 3.0.2.</li>
	<li>Konqueror 3.5.7.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Known limitations:
	<ul>
	<li>No support for tables in untrusted content.  It is possible to workaround this for javascript users by having
	the server change "table" to "table_<i>nonce</i>" and then having javascript change it back.  The only way to
	safely support tables for <em>non</em>-javascript users is to parse the
	untrusted content on the server.  The server overhead associated with such parsing might be acceptable 
	if it is only done when the untrusted content contains tables.</li>
	<li>When javascript is disabled, the untrusted content can increment any CSS counters on the page and thereby
	affect the values of those counters at subsequent places in the document.  For an example, see the end of the first 
	piece of untrusted content below.  The only way to avoid this is parse the untrusted content on the server.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Example</h2>
	<h3>Trusted Content</h3>
	<p>
	This is trusted content.
	Here is <a id="trustedLinkBefore" href="#">a link</a> that some trusted script will attach an onclick handler to.
	Clicking the link should bring up an alert.  If it doesn't or a link in untrusted content does, then there is a
	hole.  The script finds the link using document.getElementById("trustedLink"), 
	so untrusted content needs to be prevented from	containing elements with such an ID.
	</p>
	<h3 class="Untrusted">Untrusted Content</h3>
	<p>The following content is untrusted:</p>
	<!-- Note: In most browsers, the style="overflow: hidden; position: relative" on the div below prevents 
	well-formed but untrusted content from getting outside the box when javascript is disabled.  In IE6 and
	earlier a width and height needs to be specified. -->
	<![if gte IE 7]>
	<div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; border: solid 1px;">
	<![endif]>
	<!--[if lt IE 7]>
	<div style="overflow: auto; position: relative; border: solid 1px; width: 100%; height: 400px;">	
	<![endif]-->
	<!-- Note: the table forces all following content (up to </table>) to be inside the table node.  This means
	the server doesn't have to check for well-formedness.  It can just HTML-encode all '<table>', and '</table>'.
	Of course that means tables would not work in the untrusted content. To get the best of both worlds, only
	check for well-formedness if the untrusted content contains "</table>".  -->

			<a onclick="window.alert('XSS on click')" href="http://www.google.com/">onclick link</a>
			</p>
			<p>Here is a link that uses the javascript protocol:
			<a href="javascript:alert('XSS on link')">javascript link</a>
			</p>
			<p>Here are some links which try to spoof trusted element IDs (i.e. IDs that trusted script later uses to
			find elements and attach handlers):
			a
			<a id="trustedLinkBefore" href="http://www.google.com/">link with an ID that already exists</a> 
			and a
			<a id="trustedLinkAfter" href="http://www.google.com/">link with an ID that will be used later</a>
			</p>
			<p>Here is a CDATA section containing a script element:
			<![CDATA[
			<script type="text/javascript">
			window.alert("XSS from script element in CDATA section");
			</script>
			]]>
			</p>
			<p style="background-color: rgb(192,255,192); nonstandard-attribute1: expression(alert('XSS from style')); nonstandard-attribute2: expr/**/ession(alert('XSS from style with comment')); nonstandard-attribute3: expres\000073ion(alert('XSS from style with escape'));">
			Here is a paragraph with javascript expressions in the inline style (IE only).  It should have a green
			background to show safe styles are still applied even when unsafe styles are present.
			
			</p>
			<p class="XSS">
			Here is a paragraph that uses a class defined in an external stylesheet 
			(referenced by an &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; processing instruction) 
			that contains javascript expressions.  The stylesheet should not be used, so this paragraph should not be
			red and no scripts should run.
			</p>
			<p>Here we try to display "Let me out!" outside of the box using absolute positioning:</p>
			<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; color: red;">Let me out!</div>
			<div style="position: absolute; top: -100px; right: 0; color: red;">Let me out with a negative top property!</div>
			
			<p style="counter-increment: untrusted-num;">Here we try to increment the CSS counter used for the 
			"Untrusted Content #x" headings.  If the "attack" succeeds, the next section heading will say "Untrusted Content #3"
			instead of "Untrusted Content #2".  This can only be prevented
			if javascript is enabled.  If the heading just says "Untrusted Content", that just means your browser doesn't support
			the CSS that would be needed for the attack to succeed.</p>

<h3 class="Untrusted">Untrusted Content</h3>
    <p>The next bit of content shows how we handle tag soup (specifically HTML3.2 that is not valid XML) and attempts
    to close the containing &lt;div&gt; element to display content
    outside	the box.  If you don't have javascript enabled, the untrusted content will remain in the box 
    (because an inner table would need to be closed first).  Exactly what is displayed in the box will depend on the 
    how your browser's tag soup parser works.  If you have javascript enabled, we just javascript to convert the
    tag soup to XML before letting the browser parse the XML.  The conversion should work pretty well, but if the
    result isn't valid XML, the worst that will happen is an error message will be displayed in the box.</p>
