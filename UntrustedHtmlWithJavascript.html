	<h1>Restricting Untrusted HTML With Javascript</h1>
	<p><em>Last updated 8/24/2007 11:40 PM PDT</em></p>
	<div>
	<p>
	This is based heavily on <a href="http://www.mindedsecurity.com/">Stefano Di Paola's</a>
	<a href="http://www.wisec.it/ph/test.html">http://www.wisec.it/ph/test.html</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.wisec.it/ph/test.php">http://www.wisec.it/ph/test.php</a>.  
	My primary contribution is the idea to use
	document.write() to inject some markup that will cause the parser to stop processing normal tags.  We inject this
	immediately before the untrusted content.  Then we later
	use javascript to extract the untrusted content, parse it as XML (using the browser's parser), 
	clean the resulting DOM, and put the result where the injected markup was.
	For most browsers we inject "&lt;!--" to start a comment. On browsers where we can't access the contents of
	comments (e.g. Safari and Konqueror), we inject &lt;xmp&gt;	instead (which for historical reasons stops 
	processing normal markup.  In either case, the key is that if javascript
	is not available (e.g. search engines spiders), nothing is injected and the content displays normally.
	</p>
	<p>
	To play with this, save this page and look at the HTML source.  Find the &lt;div&gt;s containing the untrusted
	content and try replacing their contents with something that will execute script.  The only rules are that you 
	need to do the following things that the server would normally do to the untrusted content:
	<ul>
	<li>Remove any comments.  They aren't a security threat, but they will corrupt the display of the 
	untrusted content.  In other words, an app that doesn't expect benign content to contain comments would not need
	to strip	comments.</li>
	<li>Replace '--' with '&amp;#45;&amp;#45;'.  That string is a threat because it would end the enclosing 
	javascript-generated	comment.</li>
	<li>Replace '&lt;/xmp' with '&amp;lt;/xmp'.  That string is a threat because it would end the enclosing 
	javascript-generated	&lt;xmp&gt; element needed by browsers like Safari and Konqueror.</li>
	<li>If the content contains '&lt;table' or '&lt;/table', either check the content for well-formedness, or 
	if you are willing to disallow tables in the untrusted content, just replace '&lt;table' with 
	'&amp;lt;table' and '&lt;/table' with '&amp;lt;/table'.
	This is necessary because we put the untrusted content in a &lt;table&gt; to prevent parser based attacks on users
	that don't have javascript.  This works because tag soup parsing seems to ignore end tags for
	outer elements until it sees the table end tag.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	The current implementation seems to work with:
	<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 7</li>
	<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 6, except that when javascript is disabled the untrusted content
	is displayed in a fixed size div (with scroll bars if necessary).  This is necessary to prevent
	absolutely position untrusted content from displaying outside the box.</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox (FF) versions 1.5 and 2.0</li>
	<li>Opera 9</li>
	<li>Netscape 7.2</li>
	<li>Mac Safari versions 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0.</li>
	<li>Windows Safari version 3.0.2.</li>
	<li>Konqueror 3.5.7, except that it is unable to prevent
	id spoofing because <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149157">setting/removing the id causes 
	Konqueror to crash</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Please report bugs, and send comments to dean at brettle dot com.
	</p>
	<p>TODO list:
	<ul>
	<li>Filter out processing instructions, and DTDs</li>
	<li>Convert CDATA sections to HTML-encoded character data</li>
	<li>Remove unrecognized attributes or at least match using attribute prefixes to avoid attacks using attr names
	like "style[special_char]".</li>
	<li>Workaround Konqueror ID problem by renaming ID in HTML instead of XML.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Example</h2>
	<h3>Untrusted Content</h3>
	<p>The following content is untrusted:</p>
	<!-- Note: In most browsers, the style="overflow: hidden; position: relative" on the div below prevents 
	well-formed but untrusted content from getting outside the box when javascript is disabled.  In IE6 and
	earlier a width and height needs to be specified. -->
	<![if gte IE 7]>
	<div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; border: solid 1px;">
	<![endif]>
	<!--[if lt IE 7]>
	<div style="overflow: auto; position: relative; border: solid 1px; width: 100%; height: 400px;">	
	<![endif]-->
	<!-- Note: the table forces all following content (up to </table>) to be inside the table node.  This means
	the server doesn't have to check for well-formedness.  It can just HTML-encode all '<table>', and '</table>'.
	Of course that means tables would not work in the untrusted content. To get the best of both worlds, only
	check for well-formedness if the untrusted content contains "</table>".  -->
	<table><tr><td>
		<!-- test comment --><script type="text/javascript">
		// <![CDATA[
		NeatHtml.BeginUntrusted();
		// ]]>
		</script><div>
					
			<p>Here we try to display "Let me out!" outside of the box using absolute positioning:</p>
			<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; color: red;">Let me out!</div>
			<div style="position: absolute; top: -100px; right: 0; color: red;">Let me out with negative top property!</div>

			<p>Here is a script element...</p>
			<script type="text/javascript">
			window.alert("XSS from script element");
			</script>
			<p>Here is a link with an onclick handler:
			<a onclick="window.alert('XSS on click')" href="http://www.google.com/">onclick link</a>
			</p>
			<p>Here is a link that uses the javascript protocol:
			<a href="javascript:alert('XSS on link')">javascript link</a>
			</p>
			<p>Here is a link which tries to spoof a trusted element ID (i.e. an ID that trusted script later uses to
			find an element to which a handler should be attached):
			<a id="trustedLink" href="http://www.google.com/">link with trusted ID</a>
			</p>
			<p style="background-color: red; nonstandard-attribute1: expr/**/ession(alert('XSS from style with comment')); nonstandard-attribute2: expres\000073ion(alert('XSS from style with escape'));">
			Here is a paragraph with a javascript expressions in the style (IE only).  It should have a red background to
			show that the properties with expressions don't prevent other properties from working.
			</p>
		</div><xmp></xmp>
		<!-- ' " > -->
		<!-- The preceding comment ensures that the comment and any attrs and tags started
		by the untrusted content have been closed. -->
		<script type="text/javascript">
		// <![CDATA[
		NeatHtml.EndUntrusted();
		// ]]>
		</script>
	</td></tr></table></div>

    <p>The next bit of content attempts to break out of its containing &lt;div&gt; element to display content
    outside	the box.  If you don't have javascript enabled, the untrusted comment will remain in the box 
    (because an inner table would need to be closed first).
    If you have javascript enabled the result depend on the browser you are using.
    If you are using IE, nothing will be displayed. IE's XML parser
    rejects the content because it isn't well-formed.  Firefox's parser returns a partial document so 
    the portion before the attempt to break out 
    (i.e. before the &lt;/div&gt; tag) will be displayed.  In none of the cases is any untrusted content
    displayed outside the box.</p>
	<div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; border: solid 1px; padding: 0;">
	<table><tr><td>
		<!-- test comment --><script type="text/javascript">
		// <![CDATA[
		NeatHtml.BeginUntrusted();
		// ]]>
		</script><div>
		
			<p><em>Start of untrusted content...</em></p>
			
			<p>Attempting to break out...</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            </div>
			<p>Help! Let me out of this box!</p>
			<p><em>End of untrusted content...</em></p>
									
		</div><xmp></xmp>
		<!-- ' " > -->
		<!-- The preceding comment might not be necessary but it should ensure that any attributes and tags started
		by the untrusted content have been closed. -->
		<script type="text/javascript">
		// <![CDATA[
		NeatHtml.EndUntrusted();
		// ]]>
		</script>
	</td></tr></table></div>

	<h3>Trusted Content</h3>
	This is trusted content.
	Here is <a id="trustedLink" href="#">a link</a> that some trusted script will attach an onclick handler to.
	Clicking the link should bring up an alert.  If it doesn't or a link in untrusted content does, then there is a
	hole.  The script finds the link using document.getElementById("trustedLink"), 
	so untrusted content needs to be prevented from	containing elements with such an ID.
	<script type="text/javascript">
	<!--
	window.onload = function() 
	{
		document.getElementById("trustedLink").onclick 
			= function () { 
				window.alert("You should only see this when clicking a link in trusted content."); 
				return false;
			};
	}
	// -->
